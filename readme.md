Alcove

Tired of trudging ..., searching for _your_ storage unit?  Don't need 100 cubic feet to store your duffle bag full of baseball cards?  Have a warehouse on your property that you're looking to fill?  Alcove is your alternative storage solution.  

Alcove connects users with available storage space and users with items to store.  Users are able to search for both items and spaces within their zip codes and can filter listings by their needs and preferences.  Looking for an indoor, climate-controlled, closet-sized space to which only you have access?  You've got it!  Once you've selected the item or space you're interested in, Alcove allows you to reach out to the person who posted the listing.
